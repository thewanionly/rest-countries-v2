# Rest Countries (v2)

This project is a solution to Frontend Mentor's `REST Countries API with color theme switcher` challenge. This is built with ReactJS with TypeScript, Redux, Jest and React Testing Library. This is a responsive application and also has dark mode which showcased my css layout and architectural skills. This also involves REST API and best practices in fetching data.

Here are the complete set of technologies that I used for building this app:

- ReactJS (front-end JS library)
- TypeScript (superset of JS)
- Jest and React Testing Library (for testing)
- Redux (state management)
- Redux Thunk (middleware)
- React Router (routing)
- SASS/SCSS (css pre-processor)
- Create React App aka CRA (tooling)

## How to run the application

1. Install the packages listed in package.json by running `npm install`
2. In the project's root directory, run `npm start` to start the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
3. In the project's root directory, you can also run `npm test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode. This will execute the written unit tests.
